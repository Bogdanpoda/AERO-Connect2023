# AERO CONNECT Project

This project is a joint effort by a team of students from XYZ University to design and build a rescue and survey drone. The drone is intended to be used in search and rescue missions, as well as for surveying remote or difficult-to-reach areas. The drone is equipped with a range of sensors and capabilities that allow it to perform its intended tasks efficiently and effectively.

## Installation

The rescue and survey drone is designed to be highly maneuverable and versatile, able to navigate through a variety of terrains and environments. It is equipped with a range of sensors, including cameras, LiDAR, and GPS, that allow it to accurately survey and map areas. It is also equipped with a speaker and microphone, enabling it to communicate with people in emergency situations.



## Usage

The rescue and survey drone is intended to be used primarily in search and rescue missions. It can be deployed quickly to survey areas that are difficult or dangerous for humans to access. It can also be used to locate and communicate with people in emergency situations.

To use the drone, simply power it on and control it using the remote controller. The drone can be programmed to fly autonomously using GPS waypoints, or it can be controlled manually by an operator. The drone's cameras and sensors can be used to survey and map areas, and its speaker and microphone can be used to communicate with people in emergency situations.
